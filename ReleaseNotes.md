# Version 1.0.0.0 #

Production-ready release of NReadability. No new functionality, only bug fixes.

# Version 0.9.0.0 #

First release of NReadability. It implements almost the whole set of features from [Arc90's Readability bookmarklet](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/). However, there are a few things missing. Those are listed below:

  * there is no support for HTML frames,
  * the fallback behaviour when article content can't be extracted is not implemented.

Note also that this release should be considered a BETA release. Particualarly, performance testing and optimizations have not been performed yet.

This release is based on version 1.5.0.0 of Readability bookmarklet.
